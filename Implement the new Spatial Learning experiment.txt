2. LITERATURE SURVEY
   1. Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM)


The HTM model learns the procedure that occurs in one cortex of the brain. HTM works on continuous streams of input patterns, attempting to construct rare and constant representations of input sequences based on the input stream's recursive pattern. [1]
HTM's capacity to forecast future patterns based on previously trained data patterns. After a few cycles, HTM receives a unique pattern that compares the prior patterns to the current pattern. Input patterns should not repeat, and the uniqueness should be maintained. 
To depict patterns in the incoming data, HTM uses SDRs. Each input pattern is first transformed into an SDR, and the HTM network is then fed this SDR.
SDRs enable the efficient and effective encoding and processing of complicated and high-dimensional data patterns, which is why they are fundamental to the HTM algorithm.


   2. Sparse Distributed representations (SDRs)


Sparse Distributed representations (SDRs) of input patterns are used in HTM's language. With a set amount of active bits, it produces SDRs internally. These bits have semantic value. As a result, two inputs with equivalent semantic meaning must have equal active bit representation in SDR, which plays an important role in HTM learning.
Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) technique is based on the concept of SDRs, which are high-dimensional binary vectors with only a small fraction of the bits set to 1. SDRs are a natural way for the brain to represent patterns because they allow for the efficient storage and processing of large amounts of information.


The encoding process is similar to the operations of human and other animal sensory organs.


The cochlea, for example, is a specialized mechanism that translates the frequencies and amplitudes of external sounds into a sparse set of activated neurons. The underlying mechanism for this process (Fig. 1) consists of a row of inner hair cells that are responsive to different frequencies. When a specific frequency of sound is heard, the hair cells excite neurons, which send the signal to the brain. The set of neurons that are stimulated in this manner form the Sparse Distributed Representation of the sound.


An encoder in an HTM system initially turns a data source into an SDR.To capture the main semantic properties of the material, the encoder selects which output bits should be ones and which should be zeros. SDRs with similar input values should have a high degree of overlap. [3]

   3. Encoders
Encoders should generate SDRs with a constant number of bits 'N' and a fixed number of active (1's) bits 'W', regardless of what they represent. What do you know about the ideal values for N and W?
To preserve the features of sparsity, we cannot be a large proportion of N. But, if W is too small, we lose the features of a distributed representation.
While encoding data, there are several unique aspects to consider:
1. Semantically related data can trigger SDRs with overlapping active bits.
2. The same input should always provide the same SDR output.
3. The result will have the same dimensionality as all of the inputs (total number of bits).
Deterministic encoders should produce the same result from the same input each time. Without this attribute, the sequence learnt in HTM will be redundant because there is a shift in values with encoded representations. Put an end to creating adaptive or random element encoders.
The output of an encoder must produce the exact same number of bits for each of its inputs. SDRs are compared and handled so that a bit with a specific "value" is always at the same location using a bit-by-bit assumption. If the encoders offered various SDR bit lengths, comparisons and other operations would not be possible. [4]
